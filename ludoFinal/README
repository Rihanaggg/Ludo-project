<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
Compile and run the Testing.java class to start the game.
The game window will open, and the Ludo board will be displayed.
The game supports up to 4 players. Players take turns based on the color of their pieces (Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue).
Press the Enter key to roll the dice.
If the dice shows a number other than 6, you can move one of your pieces forward according to the number on the dice. If you roll a 6, you can either move one of your pieces from the starting position or move one of your pieces forward by six steps.
If you land on a position occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece will be sent back to its starting position (killed).
The objective is to move all your pieces from the starting area to the home area by exact dice rolls.
The first player to get all four pieces to the home area wins the game.</p>
